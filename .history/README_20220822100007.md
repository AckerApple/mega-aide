## ðŸ’¡ Fix skipped lights during attract mode

When Megacade has lighted buttons/joysticks controlled by LEDBlinky and it sits untouched for a short time, it goes into an attract mode where the lighting "dances".

2. Find the LEDBlinky app
  - On my machine the app icon was already on the desktop
  - App should open with a display
3.
