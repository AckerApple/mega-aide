## 💡 Fix skipped lights during attract mode

When Megacade has lighted buttons/joysticks controlled by LEDBlinky and it sits untouched for a short time, it goes into an attract mode where the lighting "dances". If during this attract mode some lights are not lighting, such as my machine an entire joystick was not lighting, perform the following steps:

> 👀 The solution below is for when you know the lights are working, they just don't work during attract mode

1. Exit to Windows
2. Find the LEDBlinky app `LEDBlinkyanimationAnimationEditor.exe`
  - On my machine, the app was in a Desktop folder shortcut labeled `LEDBlinky License goes here`
  - App should open with a main display that has a visual map of your buttons
3. To start fixing your attract mode animation, tap the "Animation" menu at top
4. Tap `Open...`
  - Hopefully the folder menu is targeted at a folder labeled "lwa"
  - Should be a path like `Administrator\LaunchBox\Tools\LEDBlinky\lwa`
5. If you are just trying to fix your attract mode lighting, open the file `zippy.lwax`
  - It's possible your attract animation is a different file
  - When you have opened the file, you can see what lights and also you can play the animation by find the ⏯ play/stop icon towards bottom left
6. Once you have confirmed you have the right animation file, edit the frames to add in your skipped light
  - You can navigate frame by frame, you can add frames
7. Save when complete and get back into big box and test your attract mode lighting, should be working now
