## 👀 First time needs to know

- ⚡️ The power "switch" is an arcade button. I was expecting a toggle switch, I've never seen an arcade button act as a power switch but there you go.
  - Hold down power button to force a shutdown when machine is unresponsive
- I had an exit button added, it works most everywhere but not everywhere
  - Be prepared to use trackball and left mouse button to exit those games
  - Or grab a keyboard
- ⌨️ 🐭 ❌ Avoid plugging in a keyboard with a trackpad/mouse
  - Can cause older trackball games to confuse which device to use
- My lower cabinet ring light was only one color (not change colors)
  - 🪫 The remote was not working. The battery in remote was dead on arrival
    - 🔋 I was able to replace with 2032 watch battery I had on hand
  - Ring light remote could change to dance mode but it always went back to solid color
    - ✅ I just needed to hold the lock button down for about 5 seconds to lock it in
- 💡 Do you have LEDBlinky controlled lights?
  - 💡 🕹 Do you have light up joysticks and they don't light up in games?
    - The joysticks may not be mapped to light up during game play
  - Use the LEDBlinky apps on the desktop. One app is to assign lights to joystick
    - Its a little complex at first but manageable
    - [🔗 📺 Direct timeline link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29QG7Bd9mKw) to in-depth LEDBlinky controller app tutorial
- 🥷 Mortal Kombat 11 buttons were not working
  - I was told to turn off the Wii bar sensor and that fixed my issue
  - We only turn Wii bar on for Wii games now
- 🔫 Have Gun4Ir?
  - Check IR sensors on left and right of Tv screen for damage
    - Space is so small that they get damaged
    - Mine was broke. Called EHA and was sent, free of charge, replacement
  - The Gun4ir application was on the Windows start menu
    - Use it to test, config, and then "upload settings" with every change
    - Recommend moving icon to more convenient location like desktop
    - Recommend opening this app and not trust that the settings were done yet. The auto "detect" button seems to work well
- 🔓 The BigBox main menu "unlock" code was `1111` for my machine
- How to pair/add old Wii remotes I've always had
  - The Wii sensor bar has a pair button
  - The Wii remotes have a pair button behind the battery flap
- 💡 If you have lighted buttons, they do a good job of lighting by default but typically you will want to learn how to set the lighting by platform if not by some games
  - The lighting apps are fairly easily to navigate and are on the desktop
- 🕹 Many is not most games required controller mapping
  - See where I have learned how to map things [below](#-how-to-map-buttons)

<a id="-how-to-map-buttons"></a>
## 🕹 How to map buttons

For instance, Nintendo Switch Super Smash Brothers Ultimate only worked from the game controllers but I wanted to map to Megacade joystick/button console.

1. 👉 Goto the game needing mapping in LaunchBox/BigBox
2. 🪙 Press the Player 1 coin button
3. 🧾 A dedicated menu for the game itself should be presented
  - 🍀 If lucky, the second menu item is typically a configure menu item
  - 👾 Second option, is the emulator maybe listed there and using it often takes you to emulator to perform configurations
  - 🔦 You may have to figure out on your own where the emulator is within the operating system and open it manually
    - a list of known [👾 Emulator apps is here](#-emulator-apps) to help you figure out what to open

<a id="#mame-arcade-button-mappings"></a>
### Mame arcade button mappings
- While in the game, press player 1 + joystick right

<a id="-trackball-mapping"></a>
### ⚪️ Trackball mapping

These steps are also helpful when your trackball stops working

- [📺 YouTube video direct timeline link](https://youtu.be/sLVBmAuJigY?t=346) to Mame mappings for Trackball
- While in the game, press player 1 + joystick right
- 👉 Goto input settings
- 🔦 Find Track X and Track Y and set them one at a time
- For Track X, roll trackball left and then right only
- For Track Y, roll trackball up and then down only
- Close menus, should be good to go
- HIGHLY recommended to run USB wire of trackball directly into computer


<a id="-emulator-apps"></a>
## 👾 Emulator apps

Sometimes Big Box doesn't launch the emulator when asked (Flip Box) or it doesn't list the emulater. Here are a few of the apps that allow you to configure the inputs

| System | Emulator Name |
|--- | --- |
| 🟥 Nintendo Switch | yuzu |
| 💠 PlayStation 3 | PCS3 |
| 🔴 Dreamcast | redream |
