TODO: 

FIX:
- Download app has a directory stack issue
  - occurred when saving an XInput mapping in LaunchBox Additional Apps

- small printable format out of various button mappings for systems
  - intended to be printed and visible on arcade button panel

Maybe have value:
- understand which files expose full file paths
  - ex: LEDBlinkyAnimationEditor.ini has `LastLayoutFile` which is full file path

Change to Native Install apps:
- If hard-drive size can be looked up we can warn of low disk space
  - On the detect issues page
  - EHA machines are backed to the brim and LaunchBox starts throwing generic "The Application object is being shut down
- We could scan for folders
- Maybe the only way we can load media spread across multiple drives is native app


LEDBlinky:
- input map editing
- Layout editor
  - single light editor form could use some love in how is covers the entire layout
- Control editor needs file saving
  - Want to make sure it saves right
  - Need to test more on my own machine
  - Need to see if controls.xml needs to be populated in other similar files
    - cache like files
